  "content": "Hello,\n\nlet us invite you to the second Closer Solidarity Party at Zenner / Berlin.\n\nThe first event, which took place on the 30th of July, brought us many warm feelings, hugs and inspiration, it also intentionally involved every visitor into Ukrainian reality of the present moment and reminded everyone, that the war is still fully on.\n\nThis time we concentrate all our effort and listening experience on one floor (Saal, the big one). Our decorators and sound engineer are joining the party again, so it is a second proper Closer event at Zenner aimed at sharing 'us' in Europe + raising funds for good things in Ukraine. Zenner is helping us to bring all our fantasies to life and to reinforce the sound system, it is a pleasure to come again.\n\nThe line-up is very solid and makes our friends in Berlin happily pronounce \"can't wait\" when talking to them on the phone. We are warmly welcoming Borys (who is finally on his first tour since the war started), Thomas (Zip), Fumiya, Karine and Timur. Very good, we are happy.\n\nNow... the opening (22:00):\nPlease DO come early for an intriguing and groovy opening live set of the Ukrainian musician Na Nich. This is his first gig since February. By the way, this name in Ukrainian literally means 'before it is night' and his performance is a deep goodnight story, possibly with a dance touch.\n\nThis is not a 24-hour-party, we have to stop around 10-11 in the morning. We will post the schedule on the day of the event (20th of August). This is a proper dance party, artists are not bound by any musical limits.\n\nCan't wait + join us.\n\nON THE DOORS:\n22:00 - 0:00 - 15 \u20ac, from 0:00 - 20 \u20ac\nUKRAINIAN PASSPORT: 10 \u20ac",
